# Hangman-game
A basic hangman/word guessing game written in python
# how it works: 
*The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words and prints a clue for that word. 
*The player then guesses letters they think exist in the word. 
*If the letter exists, the player is notified and the number of remaining letters to guess reduces by 1. 
*If the letter does not exist, the player loses 1 guess out of a maximum of 3 guesses.
*The game ends when either the player guesses all letters of the word correctly or runs out of guesses.
